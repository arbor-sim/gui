* Introduction

This project aims to be a comprehensive tool for building single cell models using
Arbor. It strives to be self-contained, fast, and easy to use.

- Design morphologically detailled cells for simulation in Arbor.
- Load morphologies from SWC ~.swc~, NeuroML ~.nml~, NeuroLucida ~.asc~.
- Define and highlight Arbor regions and locsets.
- Paint ion dynamics and bio-physical properties onto morphologies.
- Place spike detectors and probes.
- Export cable cells to Arbor's internal format (ACC) for direct simulation.
- Import cable cells in ACC format

This project is under active development and welcomes early feedback. Currently,
Arbor master as of March 2021 is supported and bundled with the project. Note that
the screenshots below are updated less frequently than the actual project. We aim for
a formal release with Arbor 0.6 at which point the project will stabilise and receive
regular updates alongside Arbor.

We welcome bug reports and feature requests, please use the issue tracker here on GitHub
for these purposes. Building network simulation is out of scope for this project (we might
offer a different tool, though). 

_Note_ The screenshots below are somewhat outdated, the current status offers quite a bit more.

** Interactive Definition of Regions and Locsets
[[images/locations.png]]

- Rendering of cable cell as seen by Arbor.
- Define locations in Arbor's Locset/Region DSL.
  - Live feedback by Arbor's parser.
  - Well-formed expressions are rendered immediately.
- Navigate with 
  - pan: arrow keys or C-drag,
  - zoom: +/- or mouse wheel,
  - rotate: mouse drag.
- Right-click to 
  - reset camera,
  - snap-to a defined locset,
  - set the background colour,
  - tweak morphology orientation,
  - toggle orientation guide,
  - save the currently rendered image to disk.
- Hover a segment to show
  - containing branch and regions,
  - geometry information.

** Definition of Ion Dynamics
[[images/mechanisms.png]]

- Load mechanisms from built-in catalogues.
- Define ion species.
- Set parameters of mechanisms and ions.
- Set global and cell level defaults.

** Manipulation of Cable Cell Parameters
[[images/parameters.png]]

- Set per-region parameters like temperature, resisitivities, and more.
- Set global and cell level defaults.

** Set Simulation Parameters
[[images/cv-policy.png]]
- Timestep and simulation interval.
- Add Probes, Spike Detectors.
- Set and visualise discretisation policy

* Notes
- You can adjust the GUI layout by dragging and dropping windows and tabs.
- Dragging regions will change rendering order, so overlapping regions might be better visible.
- The Arbor GUI vendors its own copy of Arbor.

* Installation

The Arbor GUI requires a functional OpenGL 3.3+ package and recent 
(as in C++20 supported) C++ compiler to be present on the system.
Listed below are the standard instructions to install per platform.
Mileage may vary, especially when installing OpenGL. You might need
to update drivers, or have to execute other environment specific patches.

Start out by cloning the repository and creating a build directory:

#+begin_example bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/thorstenhater/arbor-gui.git
cd arbor-gui
mkdir build
cd build
#+end_example

Next, follow the platform specific instructions.

** Linux (Ubuntu)

1. Install build dependencies

#+begin_example bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install libxml2-dev libxrandr-dev libxcinerama-dev \
                 libxcursor-dev libxi-dev libglu1-mesa-dev \
                 freeglut3-dev mesa-common-dev gcc-10 g++-10
#+end_example

2. Add GCC10 as alternative to GCC and select it:

#+begin_example bash
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/gcc gcc /usr/bin/gcc-10 10
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/g++ g++ /usr/bin/g++-10 10
#+end_example

Use `gcc --version` to confirm it is now version 10. If not you will
need to run `sudo update-alternatives --config gcc` (and its analog
for `g++`) and manually select the right number.

3. Install Arbor GUI

#+begin_example bash
cmake ..
sudo make install -j 4
#+end_example

*** WSL2

Users of Windows Subsystem for Linux will have to run an X-Server on
their Windows machine and use X11-forwarding to display the GUI.

1. Install [https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/][[VcXsrv]].
Make sure you add the right firewall rules and a subnet mask for 
the incoming connections. [This][[https://github.com/cascadium/wsl-windows-toolbar-launcher#firewall-rules]] 
is a great write-up of all the pitfalls you can encounter.

2. Add the following to `.bashrc`. Please note that it is similar
but not identical to snippets you'll find elsewhere:
  
#+begin_example bash
export DISPLAY=$(awk '/nameserver / {print $2; exit}' /etc/resolv.conf 2>/dev/null):0
export LIBGL_ALWAYS_INDIRECT=0
export MESA_GL_VERSION_OVERRIDE=3.3
#+end_example

** MacOS
Please use a recent version of Clang, as installed by brew for example.
The project has been confirmed to build and run with Clang 11 on BigSur
and Catalina using this line
#+begin_example bash
cmake .. -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/usr/local/opt/llvm/bin/clang++ -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=/usr/local/opt/llvm/bin/clang -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=release
#+end_example
